# neuronNetwork
for deep learning
Define your inputs and outputs. 
And set your network.
[2,3,4] = 2 cells in first layer(input), 3 cells in second layer, 4 cells in third layer (output)
[true, false, false] = there is bais cell in first layer. Always set the last layer as false.
Train your data. Network->train(input, output); 
Get output from your network.
